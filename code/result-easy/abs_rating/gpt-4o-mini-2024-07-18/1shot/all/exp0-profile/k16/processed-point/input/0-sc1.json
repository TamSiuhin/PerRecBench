They tend to rate books in this genre highly, giving 5-star ratings to titles like \"One Last Thing Before I Go\" by Jonathan Tropper, \"Six Years\" by Harlan Coben, and \"The Marauders\" by Tom Cooper. Additionally, they seem drawn to novels with female protagonists or narrators, such as those by authors like Lisa Gardner, Hank Phillippi Ryan, and Ruth Ware.\n\nHowever, the user's ratings also indicate a discerning taste, as they have given low scores to several books within the same genres, suggesting a preference for well-crafted plots and compelling characters. They have a particular aversion to novels they may perceive as formulaic or lacking in depth, as evidenced by their 1-star ratings for books like \"The Perfect Husband\" by Lisa Gardner and \"The Woman in Cabin 10\" by Ruth Ware.\n\nInterestingly, the user has also shown an appreciation for travel literature, giving a high rating to \"World's Best Travel Experiences\" by National Geographic. This suggests a potential interest in exploring different cultures and destinations, perhaps seeking vicarious experiences through literature when unable to travel in person.\n\nOverall, the user's behavior history paints a picture of an avid reader with a strong preference for engaging, well-written mysteries and thrillers, particularly those with complex female characters and psychological depth.
