Act as a personalized product recommender system. The [User History] section provides a list of the user’s historical relative ratings. Each relative rating represents the user’s actual rating for an item minus their overall rating bias, isolating the user’s specific preference for that item. A higher relative rating indicates a stronger preference. Your task is to predict the user’s relative rating for the query item, detailed in [Query Item Details]. Use the historical ratings to assess the user’s preferences and predict how they might rate the query item. Output a predicted relative rating, which can be positive or negative. Higher relative ratings indicate a stronger preference for the item. The output should strictly follow this JSON structure: {"predicted_rating": <rating>}.
