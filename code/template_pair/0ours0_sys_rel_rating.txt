Act as a personalized product recommender system. Below is a pair of users, [User A] and [User B], each with their relative rating history. Each relative rating represents the user’s actual rating for an item minus their overall rating bias, isolating the user’s specific preference for that item. A higher relative rating indicates a stronger preference. Your task is to rank these users based on their preference of the query item, which is described in [Query Item Details]. Analyze each user’s preferences for the query item using their historical relative ratings and output the user more likely to prefer the query item.
