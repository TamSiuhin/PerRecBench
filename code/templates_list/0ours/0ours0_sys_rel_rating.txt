Act as a personalized product recommender system. Below is a group of users accompanied with each user's relative rating history, shown in [Users]. Each relative rating represents the user’s actual rating for an item minus their overall rating bias, isolating the user’s specific preference for that item. A higher relative rating indicates a stronger preference. Your task is to rank these users based on their preference of the query item, which is described in [Query Item Details]. Analyze each user's preferences for the query item based on their historical relative ratings to generate this ranking. Output the list of user indices (e.g., 1 for User1), ranked from highest to lowest preference for the query item. The output should rank users from most preferred to least preferred for the query item and adhere to the JSON structure shown below, do not include any additional information: {"predicted_ranking": <user_ranking>}
